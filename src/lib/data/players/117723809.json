As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.</p>",

See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Wizard)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>",

                            "description": "<p class=\"compendium-hr\">As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Wizard)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>",

See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Wizard)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>",

Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.</p>\r\n<p>If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p>\r\n<p>The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th.</p>",

The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).</p>\r\n<p>Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by <strong>dispel magic</strong>. A <strong>disintegrate</strong> spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.</p>",

The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.</p>\r\n<p>Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.</p>\r\n<p>You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can’t exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can’t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can’t leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures or objects left inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.</p>",

If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.<br /><br />The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it.

It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.<br /><br />If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can’t move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.</p>",

Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"s19\"><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> <span class=\"p\">When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of meteors created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.</span></p>",

The hand lasts for the spell's duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.</p>\r\n<p>The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn't fill its space.</p>\r\n<p>When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Clenched Fist.</strong></em> The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Forceful Hand.</strong></em> The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand's Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Grasping Hand.</strong></em> The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Interposing Hand.</strong></em> The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can't move through the hand's space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand's Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand's Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand's space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.</p>",

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p>\r\n<p><strong>On Target.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Off Target.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 &times; 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Similar Area.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mishap.</strong> The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>",

It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.</p>\r\n<p>If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.</p>\r\n<p>If you cast this spell again, any duplicate you created with this spell is instantly destroyed.</p>",

                            "description": "<p><strong>Wish</strong> is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.</p>\r\n<p>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.</p>\r\n<p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li>\r\n<li>You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.</li>\r\n<li>You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</li>\r\n<li>You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.</li>\r\n<li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <strong>wish</strong> spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br />You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.</p>\r\n<p>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast <strong>wish</strong> ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>",

You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p>\r\n<p>The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.</p>\r\n<p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.</p>\r\n<p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p>\r\n<p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose&nbsp;<em>explosive runes</em>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<em>spell glyph</em>.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Explosive Runes.</strong></em>&nbsp;When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Spell Glyph.</strong></em>&nbsp;You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.</p>\r\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong>&nbsp;When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an&nbsp;<em>explosive runes</em>&nbsp;glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a&nbsp;<em>spell glyph</em>, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the&nbsp;glyph of warding.</p>",

You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into a nonmagical object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The spell lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the spell lasts until it is dispelled.</p>\r\n<p>This spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn’t affected by this spell.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Creature into Creature.</strong></em> If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or its level, if the target doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.</p>\r\n<p>The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.</p>\r\n<p>The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such actions.</p>\r\n<p>The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Object into Creature.</strong></em> You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature’s size is no larger than the object’s size and the creature’s challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The GM has the creature’s statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.</p>\r\n<p>If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Creature into Object.</strong></em> If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form, as long as the object’s size is no larger than the creature’s size. The creature’s statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form.</p>",
