The first part of the process required the hilt and the blade to be separated, which Khazan accomplished. While Khazan was busying himself destroying the blade, his apprentice stole the hilt and fled. Khazan later located his apprentice’s mutilated corpse in the Svalich Woods, but the hilt was nowhere to be found. To avoid the vampire’s wrath, Khazan told Strahd that the entire weapon had been destroyed.</p>\r\n<p>The hilt, which is sentient, knows that it can never be reunited with its original crystal blade. It has, however, gained the properties of a sun blade.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> The <em>Sunsword</em> is a sentient chaotic good weapon with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 17, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions to the creature carrying or wielding it.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> The <em>Sunsword</em>’s special purpose is to destroy Strahd, not so much because it wants to free the land of Barovia from evil but because it wants revenge for the loss of its crystal blade.

It is lightweight and has an otherworldly texture, almost as if shadows cling to it, shifting and swirling with the movement of the wearer.&nbsp;While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom (Perception) checks made to see you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide, as the cloak's color shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Properties:</strong></h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Stealth Enhancement</strong>: While wearing the Enchanted Cloak of Shadows, the wearer has <strong>advantage on Stealth checks</strong> when they are in <strong>dim light or darkness</strong>. The cloak aids in concealing the wearer by blending them seamlessly with their shadowy surroundings.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><strong>Usage</strong>:</h4>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Blending into Darkness</strong>: In dim light or darkness, the cloak’s material seems to melt into the shadows, making it harder to notice the wearer. The advantage it grants to Stealth checks only applies in areas where shadows or dim lighting exist, as the cloak’s power is tied to those conditions.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Visual Effect</strong>: The cloak subtly ripples like shadows in the wind. When worn in darkness, the fabric appears to merge with the surrounding shadows, creating the illusion that the wearer is a part of the gloom. In brighter areas, however, it looks like an ordinary black cloak.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4><strong>Limitations</strong>:</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Light Sensitivity</strong>: The cloak’s shadow-blending properties only function in dim light or darkness. In brightly lit areas, it provides no special bonuses to Stealth checks.</li>\r\n</ul>",

You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.</p>\r\n<p>Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence.

Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Comet.</strong> If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Donjon.</strong> You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Euryale.</strong> The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a &minus;2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Fates.</strong> Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Flames.</strong> A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Fool.</strong> You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Gem.</strong> Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Idiot.</strong> Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Jester.</strong> You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key.</strong> A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Knight.</strong> You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Moon.</strong> You are granted the ability to cast the <strong>wish</strong>&nbsp;spell 1d3 times.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rogue.</strong> A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a <strong>wish</strong> spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ruin.</strong> All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Skull.</strong> You summon an avatar of death--a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.</p>\r\n<div class=\"line monster height1 marginTop15 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h5>Avatar of Death</h5>\r\n<p><em>Medium undead, neutral evil</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 20 <br /><strong>Hit Points</strong> half the hit point maximum of its summoner <br /><strong>Speed</strong> 60 ft., fly 60 ft.

Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Throne.</strong> You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Vizier.</strong> At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Void.</strong> This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.</p>",

The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte's stench).</p>\r\n<p>As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.</p>\r\n<p>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.</p>\r\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels.&nbsp;</strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.</p>",

When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.</p>\r\n<p>At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you.
