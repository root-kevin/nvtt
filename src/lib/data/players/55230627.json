If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom.

As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal&mdash;perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"\u003ESuch details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects.

Followers of these deities seek to put wandering spirits to rest, destroy the undead, and ease the suffering of the dying. Their magic also allows them to stave off death for a time, particularly for a person who still has some great work to accomplish in the world.

              "description": "\u003Cp\u003EWhen you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose&nbsp;\u003Cem\u003Eexplosive runes\u003C/em\u003E&nbsp;or a&nbsp;\u003Cem\u003Espell glyph\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplosive Runes.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E&nbsp;When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpell Glyph.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E&nbsp;You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAt Higher Levels.\u003C/strong\u003E&nbsp;When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an&nbsp;\u003Cem\u003Eexplosive runes\u003C/em\u003E&nbsp;glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a&nbsp;\u003Cem\u003Espell glyph\u003C/em\u003E, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the&nbsp;glyph of warding.\u003C/p\u003E",

On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects and then becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, the target takes 1d8 thunder damage, and the spell ends.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis spell’s damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target on a hit, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8 and 3d8) and again at 17th level (3d8 and 4d8).\u003C/p\u003E",
